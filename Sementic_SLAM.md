Follow the conventional pipeline of SLAM, here are some paper utilizing semantic info.
# Source of info (Prediction)
This kind of methods predict (rather than extract directly) extra information from sensor data.
## Monocular Depth prediction
## Monocular Scale recovery
Recovering stable scale in monocular SLAM using object-supplemented bundle adjustment
## 

# Data Association
Given info, the next problem is to determine the correspondence. Robust and efficient data association is the core issue in SLAM.
## Filter Noisy Info
Dynamic object, point from vegetation are harmful for SLAM, which focus on static world.
##High-level feature
